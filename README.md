# particle-arena
A Python-based interactive particle simulation where each particle represents a player. Particles move around, collide, and lose health based on collision force. The last particle alive wins!

TODO:
- Review the simulator's physics to ensure that collisions occur correctly according to physical logic and that health is lost appropriately.
